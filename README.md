# InstagramBOT_API

InstagramBOT application API. API aims to automate various actions on an Instagram account to increase the number of followers. With this application, you can perform a number of actions such as automatic liking and commenting on posts, selectively following other users. All this was designed to greatly speed up the process of building a community on Instagram and help you succeed on this platform - there is only one small problem: the application is ineffective. After some time, the actions performed by the bot are caught by the algorithm on the Instagram platform as a result of which the project was abandoned.
